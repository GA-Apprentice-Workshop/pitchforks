## Notes current commit:
* Run DRY APP with `nodemon server.js`
* The DRY routes and handlers are in the /routes folder
* The DRY config(variables and such) is application.js
* The DB file is the same for both versions

Old app is `nodemon app.js`. Works fine. The new app works except for the form pages (login and sign-up). The index page for the app is called from the database.
