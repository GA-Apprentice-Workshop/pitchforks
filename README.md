Pitchforks
==========

Organize protests and find protests happening NOW in your part of the world!

Pitchforks was inspired by a very simple idea: create a small app that would allow users to see, in real-time, protests happening around the world. And I don't mean just newscasts: a map of protests that would show live participants displayed on a map, along side corroborating news coverage. My thought was to give everyone a sense of urgency about public matters and show them that there are many people who care about the issue. 

With this data, we could begin to see dozens of protests inspired by the same cultural events in multiple places -- even across continents and oceans!

Pitchforks is currently being designed more as a protest organizing tool. My goals are to:

* Make location data available to organizers and participants.
* Provide relevant data about the protest in one place.
* Give protesters a sense of the work going on behind the protests, such as drafting legislation, court proceedings and local ordinances.

This got ambitious very fast, but I believe this to be a worthwhile project with powerful potential.
