{"name":"Pitchforks","tagline":"Find and organize protests happening near you.","body":"Pitchforks\r\n==========\r\n\r\nFind and organize protests happening near you. For citizens, you can get immediate updates on where the protests are so you can join in and support them. For organizers, Pitchforks is a tool that provides a documented cause for that protest.\r\n\r\nHave you seen a protest and wondered what was going on? If you'd had Pitchforks, you could have not only found out how many people were there, but why they were there. You could have read law proposals and negotiations to learn about the grievances and what protesters hoped to achieve. \r\n\r\nAnd you can do all that with just a couple of clicks.\r\n\r\nOrganize protests and find protests happening NOW in your part of the world!\r\n\r\nPitchforks was inspired by a very simple idea: create a small app that would allow users to see, in real-time, protests happening around the world. And I don't mean just newscasts: a map of protests that would show live participants displayed on a map, along side corroborating news coverage. My thought was to give everyone a sense of urgency about public matters and show them that there are many people who care about the issue. \r\n\r\nWith this data, we could begin to see dozens of protests inspired by the same cultural events in multiple places -- even across continents and oceans!\r\n\r\nPitchforks is currently being designed more as a protest organizing tool. My goals are to:\r\n\r\n* Make location data available to organizers and participants.\r\n* Provide relevant data about the protest in one place.\r\n* Give protesters a sense of the work going on behind the protests, such as drafting legislation, court proceedings and local ordinances.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects.
